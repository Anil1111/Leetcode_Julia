**Introduction**<br>

It is time for me to write a eulogy to praise my hard work. I just solved 37 hard level algorithms by any means last three years. 

I like to document all those algorithms I solved, and then review them, share them on Leetcode discuss, and prepare to work on more. But this time I am much more smart, I solved easy level 200 algorithms first; and I play Leetcode weekly contest every week; I also constantly learn how to find good ideas to advance myself in terms of problem solving. 

Here are the hard level algorithms:

[4]<br>
