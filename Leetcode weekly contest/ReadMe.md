I am a rookie to play Leetcode weekly contest. I just came back to play Leetcode weekly contest no matter how busy I am.

**weekly contest 107**<br>
I worked on hard level algorithm, the code had bugs in the contest so I could not pass online judge. <br>
[Here](https://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/10/ielts-reading.html) is the blog I wrote to work on my English reading skills. <br>
[Reading challenge](https://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/10/ielts-reading-related-to-algorithm.html) is found in one of easy level algorithms. <br>

**weekly contest 108**<br>
I worked on a medium level algorithm, I chose the solution to get into too much detail, such as positions of each 1 in the array. I spent one hour with 5 submissions, each extra submission 5 minutes penalty. <br>

**weekly contest 109**<br>
I worked on the second algorithm, and then I chose to write a time-consuming solution instead. I could not submit the second algorithm for technical reason. 

**weekly contest 110**<br>
This is my most favorite contest. I solved the first two algorithms, and then rest two I did spend time to read the problem statements in the contest, and also I thought about the solutions for each of them. I felt that one day I can solve four of them.

Question 3 can be solved using brute force solution. Question 4 is also can be solved using dynamic programming solution. 

**weekly contest 111**<br>
The contest was my favorite one. 
I solved question 1 and 3. And I did have problems to understand the question 2 and test case 1. 

I like to write down my experience with question 2. My problem was that I started to write code and then fixed the code, and then I found out that I should write a different solution since the requirement is different from what I thought. I should figure out the requirement first in the contest, because the time is limited. 

I read the hard level algorithm at the very beginning, and this is the first time I spent first five minutes to read hard level algorithm in the contest. 

**weekly contest 112**<br>

I start to challeng myself to prepare hard level algorithm in the contest. At least I will spend a few minutes to read the last algorithm and think about a few minutes at the very beginning of the contest. I also read all the algorithms first and evaluate the difficulty levels. 

After the contest, I try to push myself to solve all algorithms in an additional hour if possible. 

I like to put together the folder for each contest as well. I also like to write down my favorite learning from others. <br>


**weekly contest 113**<br>
I wrote a blog to document the frustration I had on the third algorithm in the contest. I spent over 40 minutes in the contest to solve the third algorithm. <br>
