I like to write down something to encourage myself to perform better next time. It takes time for me to improve my performance on weekly contest. <br>

**Q3: 923. 3Sum With Multiplicity**<br><br>
I did not have time to fix all bugs in the third algorithm. I came out the optimal solution, but I wrote buggy code. After the contest, I spent extra 40 minutes to finish the coding. It took me six submissions to pass the online judge. <br>

[923. 3Sum With Multiplicity](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-with-multiplicity/discuss/181167/C-It-actually-took-me-exactly-one-hour-and-also-the-sixth-submission-passed-online-judge) is to document my practice in the contest and after the contest. <br>

**Performance**<br>

If I can solve the third algorithm, the ranking will go up to 1000/3068. And the ranking of contest will go up to 1800. Right now my top performance is around 1600. <br>
