I will write something for my favorite weekly contest. 

[945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-to-make-array-unique/discuss/197791/C-hard-than-I-thought-in-the-contest)<br>
[946. Validate Stack Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/discuss/197797/C-my-tip-is-to-identify-minimum-use-cases)<br>
[948. Bag of Tokens](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/discuss/197803/C-the-greedy-algorithm-is-so-challenging)<br>

I learned from the player with ranking top 1200, who wrote the statement in more accurate and meaningful way. 

[Rewrite problem statement of 948](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/discuss/197856/bad-descriptions/202343)<br>
