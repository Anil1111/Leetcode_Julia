A friend gave me three mock interviews in May 2018. Here are the blogs for three mock interviews. 

**First interview** <br>
May 23, 2018 <br>
[Leetcode 42 - Trap rain water](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/05/being-interviewee-leetcode-42-trap-rain.html) hard level <br>

**Second interview** <br>
May 29, 2018<br>
[Leetcode 57 Insert interval](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/05/being-interviewee-insert-intervals.html) hard level <br>

**Third mock interview**<br>

Two algorithms were given to me to work on. <br>
[Sort the array - using one iteration](https://gist.github.com/jianminchen/bed337318339a36e20a7d2a3b8311288) <br>

[Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements](https://gist.github.com/jianminchen/fa927d3de4cfc01874222902e0c3bc92)<br>

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the 
lower alphabetical order comes first.
