Leetcode algorithms 

Starting from September 3, 2015, I started my first practice on Leetcode algorithms. So far I have practiced over 150 algorithms up to August 15, 2018. 

[Here](https://leetcode.com/jianminchen39/) is my Leetcode profile.

I like to motivate myself to practice Leetcode easy level algorithms every day. I started from July 17, in two weeks I practiced and submitted over 35 algorithms.

I know that I have to put a lot of hard work in order to submit 35 algorithms in two weeks. I admire those people submitted more than 1000 sumbission last 12 months, and solved over 500 algorithms on Leetcode.com

Here are my two weeks practice folder:

Here is the blog I wrote called where to find most hard working people. I like to have some role models and encourage myself to train using Leetcode online judge and a lot of easy level algorithms.

I like to encourage myself to share my practice on Leetcode discussion panel. It is important to share my C# code and write down my practice, highlights of the practice. I like to figure out how I can improve myself in terms of algorithm problem solving. 

The folder is added here.
