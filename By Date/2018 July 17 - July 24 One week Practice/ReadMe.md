I like to study my one week practice, and then I can figure out how to build a good habit to train myself everyday using Leetcode online judge. Starting from easy level algorithms, I like to write code every day, and train myself to think hard on easy level algorithms. 

Here is the first blog I like to study how to build a good habit to write code every day.
