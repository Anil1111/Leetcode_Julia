**Two weeks preparation**<br>

I like to study my one week practice, and then I can figure out how to build a good habit to train myself everyday using Leetcode online judge. Starting from easy level algorithms, I like to write code every day, and train myself to think hard on easy level algorithms. 
 
[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/07/one-week-for-new-habit.html) is the first blog I like to study how to build a good habit to write code every day. 

The most challenging part is to work on bit manipulation. I totally forgot how quick and easy is to use bit manipulation using bit operator >> or <<, and And, OR etc. operators. 

I have to find ways to build a good habit to write code every day. Using Leetcode easy level alogoritms I can easily train myself and also start to build habit to write code every day.
