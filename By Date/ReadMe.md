You do not practice, you do not deserve to win. Andre Agassi

I like to motivate myself to practice Leetcode easy level algorithms every day. I started from July 17, in two weeks I practiced and submitted over 35 algorithms. 

I know that I have to put a lot of hard work in order to submit 35 algorithms in two weeks. I admire those people submitted more than 1000 sumbission last 12 months, and solved over 500 algorithms on Leetcode.com

Here are my two weeks practice folder:
