**Introduction**

I like to document my Leetcode algorithm practice in 2018. I think that I learn something different from the world this year. 

I have chance to meet the employers and learn the importance to get motivated and also contribute to the software developer community.

I have chance to attend Microsoft event, and also visit Amazon headquarter building this June. And I had chance to work with best talent from Tsinghua university. I have chance to work with hundreds of players on pramp.com, interviewing.io platform.

**Goals**

A smart programmer learns to set the goal and manage herself in terms of advance reading skills, problem solving skills, soft skills including confidence, staying calm, learning how to give and take etc. 

**Leetcode solved algorithm goal - 400**<br>

I like to get into competitive programming world. One of my goals is to move up my Leetcode rankings. 

One thing I like to do is also to set the goal using solved algorithms, contests performance on Leetcode.com. It is not easy to reach the goal. I have solved 208 algorithms right now. 

I did look into and some of top players on Leetcode contest global ranking list top 250, one of players said that he finished 500 algorithms in 45 days. 

I know that it took me over 60 days to complete 100 easy level algorithm. Actually it is from July 10 to Sept. 18, 2018. I do think that it is very healthy life style to write code every day, work on easy level, try to write simple code, and avoid complicated user cases. 
I think that learning of those 100 easy level algorithms is so good. 

**Leetcode contest performance**<br>

I like to advance my Leetcode contest performance as well. First thing I like to do is to play contest every week. I need to build a good habit to get into the contest community, and also talk about the contest experience, and share my experience. 

Things I can talk can be anything, difference from Hackerrank contest. One hour 30 minutes contest, how to prepare? How to follow up?

To build a community around Leetcode contest and get involved more, it is not easy task. I certainly can work on some ideas, and also it will help me to get more involved in the contest. 

My ranking of contest is around 14,000. My goal is to get into first 10,000. Maybe I should aim at global ranking top 5000. Because I want to work for Facebook one day. 

**Time to review my practice**<br>

It is also learning experience to read my own code. I like to find out if I can shorten the time to complete the coding. A lot of things should be reviewed.
