It is my favorite algorithm to ask interviewees on interviewing.io after I worked on the algorithm in the weekly contest 115. <br>

I also took the time to learn various ideas to solve the problem through the interviewees I worked with. 

Here are the ideas I like to write based on my experience to work with various interviewees. 

1. Original idea I came out in the contest. Use inorder traversal and then mark the first node missing child. 
2. Give a root node an index value 1, and left child and right child's index values are based on parent's value. 
3. Use Queue to traversal tree, in other words, use breadth first search. 
4. I will come out ideas later.
