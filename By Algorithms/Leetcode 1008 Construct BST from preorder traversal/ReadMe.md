**How to hack a solution in less than five minutes?** <br>

I wrote a solution in weekly contest 127, but it took me 52 minutes to pass online judge. I had to spend time to debug how to set start and end index for left child and right child. <br>

After the contest, I checked the ranking No. 1 Neal Wu's code for the algorithm, and it took him less than 4 minutes. He chose to use IList<int> data structure instead of using array. <br>

Extra space is not a concern, but time efficient is biggest concern. There are four algorithms in the contest. <br>

Two solutions, one is 3 minutes, one is 52 minutes. <br> The time I spent is 17 * 3 minutes. <br>
