The algorithm is called complete binary tree inserter. I worked on the algorithm first time in the weekly contest 105. 

I had difficulty to write the code in the contest. I thought about a few ideas, one thing is to use Dictionary<int, TreeNode>, so I can easily save all nodes in the tree to a dictionary first. I know that it is easy to determine the parent node's index if the child node's index is avaiable. 

I still had to push myself hard in the contest in order to write working code. But I did not write down the code since I only had over 20 minutes to write. 

[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/10/919-complete-binary-tree-inserter.html) is the blog I wrote after the contest. I reviewed three ideas and then wrote all three ideas. One idea is hard to write and it took me five submissions.
