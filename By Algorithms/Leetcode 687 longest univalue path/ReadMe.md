The algorithm called longest univalue path is my favorite interview algorithm. I have asked more than 8 interviewees to work on the algorithm in my past 6 month mock interviews. <br>

I like to write down the algorithm the interviewee wrote every time, and then submit it on Leetcode.com. <br>

I gave the algorithm to an interviewee in the mock interview 10:00 PM in Nov. 4, who likes to apply Google, Facebook, Uber, with five year experience in Microsoft. She wrote the solution and explained to me her idea. The recursive function is designed to work on longest univalue path, the return value is how many nodes in the path. <br>

I made a minor change, and the code can be looked up [here](). <br>
