**Road to master the post order traversal tree algorithm**<br>

I usually take time to learn a tree algorithm. I have very good experience to work on longest univalue path easy level tree algorithm on interviewing.io. I learn so many solutions from over 20 interviews. I worked with different people and learne how they solve the problem creatively. <br>

I plan to take some time to master the tree algorithm post order iterative by asking interviewees as well. <br>

Here is my practice on Dec. 2018. <br>
